Idea 1:
We will be using the Eventful API, Spotify API, and Google Calendar API to create a web app that connects you with upcoming performing artists. 
In this app, users will login and view the upcoming concerts in a selected area using the Eventful API. 
They will be given the option to add specific concerts to their Google Calendar, and will show if there are any conflicts. 
Finally, using the Spotify API, the app will generate a playlist with the top songs of the artists that the user had selected. 
The database will contain the login information, and authentication for Google Calendar and Spotify will be required. 

Idea 2:
This app is a voice recognition game for a group of friends. The game has several rounds, where in each round, 
one user is prompted to sing a part of a song. The recording of the singing gets sent to the friends playing the game, 
and the friends have to match the audio recording to the photo of the person who was singing. The app uses Facebook authentication to get 
a profile image, and uses Mediarecoder API to record and save media locally. Finally, it will use Musixmatch API to get lyrics for the songs
 that need to be sung, and Spotify API to obtain songs to be sung. 

Idea 2:
In this app we will use the Uber Experiences API to retrieve trip information of a rider's destination. 
The app will get the geographical coordinates, and using the FourSquare and/or Yelp API, 
it will generate recommendations on places and restaurants near the destination. The recommendations will be 
provided according to top ratings, and will be provided with a map to show your distance from each recommendation. 
It will use a database to store login information and the places the rider had visited in the past 
to create better recommendations in the futre.
