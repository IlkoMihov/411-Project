Idea 1:
We will be using the Eventful API, Spotify API, and Google Calendar API to create a web app that connects you with upcoming performing artists. <br />In this app, users will login and view the upcoming concerts in a selected area using the Eventful API. They will be given the option to add specific concerts to their Google Calendar, and will show if there are any conflicts. <br />Finally, using the Spotify API, the app will generate a playlist with the top songs of the artists that the user had selected. The database will contain the login information, and authentication for Google Calendar and Spotify will be required.
